<p>I developed a tool that aimed to streamline the annotation process for chart corpora in SVG elements, enabling efficient automation of data extraction.</p>
<p>Common data on the format, scope, collection method, annotations, and diversity of SVG charts were collected to automate visualization patterns from key features in SVG elements.</p>
<p>I wrote a Python script to convert a static webpage into an HTTP backend server that serves files, handles GET requests, and processes POST requests to save JSON data to files.</p>
<p>This acted as a save feature by exporting and reloading specific annotation variables to the HTTP server.</p>

<p>I worked on a tool aimed to streamline the annotation process for chart corpora in SVG elements, enabling efficient automation of data visualization.</p>
<p>In this project, I conducted examined of 56 chart corpora that were used for automated chart analysis. During this process, I extracted common data on the format, scope, collection method, annotations, and diversity of SVG charts to determine patterns.</p>
<p>In the backend development, I utilized Node.js to export specific annotation variables and implemented a reloading function for data management.</p>

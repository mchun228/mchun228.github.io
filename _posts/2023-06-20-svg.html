<p>I worked on a tool aimed to streamline the annotation process for chart corpora in SVG elements, enabling efficient automation of data visualization.</p>
<p>In this project, I conducted examined of 56 chart corpora that were used for automated chart analysis. During this process, I extracted common data on the format, scope, collection method, annotations, and diversity of SVG charts to determine patterns.</p>
<p>In the backend development, I wrote a Python script to convert a static webpage into an HTTP backend server that serves files, handles GET requests, and processes POST requests to save JSON data to files.</p>
<p>Additionally, I implemented a save feature by exporting and reloading specific annotation variables to the HTTP server.</p>
